"""
direct_market.py — Shared, DEMAND-DRIVEN Bybit market-price collector
using plain HTTP requests through a Decodo ISP proxy (NO Playwright, NO
browser session).

Confirmed locally: Bybit's own public web endpoint
    POST https://www.bybit.com/x-api/fiat/otc/item/online
can be called directly with `requests` (no API key / HMAC signing needed —
this is the same request the public P2P page itself makes) as long as the
call is routed through a residential/ISP-class proxy (Bybit blocks plain
datacenter IPs from this endpoint) and sent with browser-like headers.
Decodo's ISP proxy satisfies that; this module never touches Browserbase
or a real browser.

ARCHITECTURE:
  1. ONE background asyncio loop (start_direct_market_collector), started
     once at bot startup — see bot.py's startup block. It does NOT start
     making requests immediately; see point 9 below.
  2. While a pair has demand, every REFRESH_SECONDS (~10s) it makes ONE
     request for that pair through the Decodo proxy.
  3-4. The latest result REPLACES that pair's snapshot in the shared
     in-memory cache below (guarded by _lock).
  5-8. auto_update_loop (bot.py) never calls Bybit for this — it only
     ever reads get_direct_market_snapshot(). However many ads/users are
     in "decodo_market" (displayed as "Quick Market") mode on the same
     pair, this is still exactly ONE Bybit/Decodo request per pair per
     refresh cycle, total.
  9. DEMAND-DRIVEN, same idea as market_collector.py's Browserbase
     collector, to keep Decodo bandwidth/request usage down:
       - At boot, and whenever nobody wants a pair, that pair makes ZERO
         requests — the loop just polls its own demand registry cheaply.
       - bot.py calls register_demand()/unregister_demand() every cycle
         (see auto_update_loop's decodo_market branch) — never per-poll,
         never per-user.
       - A pair only actually goes idle again after IDLE_GRACE_SECONDS
         (default 60s = "at least 1 minute") of having NO demand at all —
         this absorbs brief gaps (e.g. mid-redeploy resume, or one user
         stopping right as another starts) without flapping the
         collector on and off.
       - The moment demand reappears for an idle pair, its status flips
         to 'starting' immediately and an internal wake event nudges the
         loop to fetch on its very next tick rather than waiting out a
         full idle-poll interval — so the "first request is a little
         slower" cold start is as short as practically possible, and
         every cycle after that is at full 10s speed.
  10-12. On a failed fetch, the snapshot's price/nickname/ad_id/fetched_at
     are left completely untouched — only `status` and `last_error`
     change. The next successful cycle is what actually replaces them.

CONCURRENCY: start_direct_market_collector() is idempotent — a second
call is a harmless no-op (logged), guarded by _start_lock. Within the one
loop that does run, each pair's fetch is awaited before starting the
next, and the whole cycle is awaited before sleeping — there is no path
by which two fetches for the same pair can ever be in flight at once.

DECODO ENV VARS (required):
    DECODO_USERNAME   — Decodo proxy username
    DECODO_PASSWORD   — Decodo proxy password
    DECODO_HOST       — the host/IP Decodo gave you for this proxy
    DECODO_PORT       — the port Decodo gave you for this proxy
Optional:
    DIRECT_MARKET_REFRESH_SECONDS     — default 5 (active-pair cadence)
    DIRECT_MARKET_IDLE_POLL_SECONDS   — default 3  (idle-check cadence
                                         while NOTHING has demand)
    DIRECT_MARKET_IDLE_GRACE_SECONDS  — default 60 (how long a pair keeps
                                         being refreshed after its last
                                         demand signal, before it's
                                         actually treated as idle)
    DIRECT_MARKET_BTC_NGN_AMOUNT      — default "200000" (matches the
                                         confirmed-working test payload)
    DIRECT_MARKET_USDT_USD_AMOUNT     — default "50"
Credentials are read from the environment only — never logged, never
hardcoded.
